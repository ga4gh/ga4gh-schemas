API Overview
!!!!!!!!!!!!

The API is designed for sharing genomic data. It currently has support
for sharing sequencing reads, genetic variants, and reference genomes.
The following sections give an overview of the API, including general
API patterns, individual data types, and links to detailed schema
documentation.

Reads
@@@@@

Reads are genetic data generated by a DNA sequencing instrument,
including nucleotides and quality scores.  Reads may optionally
be aligned to a reference sequence.
(The data model for reads is similar to `SAM/BAM`_.)

Variants
@@@@@@@@

Variants are genetic differences between an experimental sample and
a reference sequence.
(The data model for variants is similar to `VCF`_.)

References
@@@@@@@@@@

References are standard genome sequences, used to provide a coordinate
system for reads and variants.

Sequence Annotations
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Sequence annotations describe genomic features such as genes and exons,
using terms from an established sequence ontology.

Metadata
@@@@@@@@

Metadata allows organizing all the primary data types.

Allele Annotations
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Allele annotations are additional pieces of data often generated by
algorithms which help to describe, classify, and understand variants.
