Variants API

See `Variants schema <../schemas/variants.html>`_ for a detailed reference.


Variants Data Model
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The Variants data model, although based on the VCF format, allows for more versaitle
interaction with the data. Instead of sending whole VCF files, the
server can send information on specific variants or genomic regions
instead. And instead of getting the whole genotype matrix, it's
possible to just get details for one or more specified individuals.

The API uses four main entities to represent variants. The following
diagram illustrates how these entities relate to each other to
constitute the genotype matrix.

The lowest-level entity is a Call:

    * a :avro:record:`Call` encodes the genotype of an individual with
      respect to a variant, as determined by some analysis of
      experimental data.

The other entities can be thought of as collections of Calls that have
something in common:

    * a :avro:record:`VariantSet` supports working with a collection
      of Calls intended to be analyzed together.
    * a :avro:record:`Variant` supports working with the subset of
      Calls in a VariantSet that are at the same site and are
      described using the same set of alleles. The Variant entity
      contains:
    
        * a variant description: a potential difference between
          experimental DNA and a reference sequence, including the
          site (position of the difference) and alleles (how the bases
          differ)
        * variant observations: a collection of Calls describing
          evidence for actual instances of that difference, as seen in
          analyses of experimental data

    * a :avro:record:`CallSet` supports working with the subset of
      Calls in a VariantSet that were generated by the same analysis
      of the same sample. The CallSet includes information about which
      sample was analyzed and how it was analyzed, and is linked to
      information about what differences were found.

The following diagram shows the relationship of these four entities to
each other and to other GA4GH API entities. It shows which entities
contain other entities (such as :avro:record:`VariantSetMetadata`),
and which contain IDs that can be used to get information from other
entities (such as :avro:record:`Variant`'s ``variantSetId``). The
arrow points *from* the entity that contains the ID *to* the entity
that can be identified by that ID.

FIXME: remove the Sample object from the graphic; that object isn't
(yet) defined in the API.
