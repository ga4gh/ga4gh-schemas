// FPKM - number of Fragments Per Kilobase of feature length per Million reads
// FPKM is calculated by dividing the fragment count per feature by the total
// number of reads in millions (FPM - Fragments Per Million).  FPM is then
// divided by feature length in kilobases to obtain FPKM.

// TPM - Transcripts per kilobase Per Million reads
// TPM is calculated by first dividing the fragment/read count by feature length
// in kilobases (RPK - Reads Per Kilobase).  The count of all RPKs in the sample
// are then divided by a million to generate a 'per million' scaling value.  For
// each feature RPK divided by the 'per million' scaling factor generated TPM.
