/******************  /genotypephenotypes/search  *********************/
/*
This request maps to the body of `POST /genotypephenotype/search` as JSON.

The goal here is to allow users to query using one or more of
Genotype, Phenotype, Environment, and Evidence.

A query using one of the above items is to mean, by default,
that the remainder of the query is as a "wildcard", such
that all matches to just that query term would come back.
Combinations of the above are to act like AND rather than OR.

The "genotype" part of the query methods can be one or more
genomic features.  Associations can be made at many
levels of granularity (from whole genotypes down to individual
SNVs), but users may use these methods with partial or
inexact information.  Therefore, the query methods must be
able to support query of some or all of the associated features.
Furthermore, use of the relationships between genomic features
means that when querying for a gene, any variants to that
gene are also returned.  For example, a query with
BRCA2 would mean that in addition to any direct associations
to the BRCA2, all associations to sequence variants of BRCA2 would also
be returned.  Similarly, queries with OntologyTerms should perform
the subclass closure.

Each query can be made against a string, an array of external
identifers (such as for gene or SNP ids), ontology term ids, or
full feature/phenotype/evidence objects.
