Gets a list of `ReadAlignment`s for one or more `ReadGroup`s.

`searchReads` operates over a genomic coordinate space of reference sequence
and position defined by the `Reference`s to which the requested `ReadGroup`s are
aligned.

If a target positional range is specified, search returns all reads whose
alignment to the reference genome *overlap* the range. A query which specifies
only read group IDs yields all reads in those read groups, including unmapped
reads.

All reads returned (including reads on subsequent pages) are ordered by genomic
coordinate (by reference sequence, then position). Reads with equivalent genomic
coordinates are returned in an unspecified order. This order must be consistent
for a given repository, such that two queries for the same content (regardless
of page size) yield reads in the same order across their respective streams of
paginated responses.

`POST /reads/search` must accept a JSON version of `SearchReadsRequest` as
the post body and will return a JSON version of `SearchReadsResponse`.
