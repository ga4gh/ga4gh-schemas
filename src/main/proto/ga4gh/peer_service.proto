/*
This interface provides a peer listing functionality for servers.
Clients can create listings of GA4GH services by requesting peer
lists from known network participants.

Network membership is voluntary, in that each peer is free to
manage its peer list.

To announce a peer simply send a well-formed announce message with the URL
of the service to be announced.

To assist with more complicated network scenarios a handshake exchange
will help in forming useful announce messages.

Alice makes a GetInfoRequest to Bob. Bob responds with a GetInfoResponse
that tells Alice the protocol version he hosts, as well as the address Bob
is using to identify Alice (by inspecting the incoming request). Then Alice
views the returned GetInfoResponse and takes the value from the `remote_url`
field and places into the `url` of an AnnouncePeerRequest. Although the port
and path that the service is running behind may be different, Alice now
knows an address that Bob can use to resolve her service.

Alice's AnnouncePeerRequest now contains a hostname or IP that can be used to
resolve her system from Bob's service. Since we don't require GA4GH services
to run at the base path of a hostTo guarantee that the path on the
AnnouncePeerRequest is correct, Alice will have to add the port path that her
service runs behind: `http://alice:1234/extra/path` to ensure any future
messages from Bob are routed to the right endpoint.
