/*
 * This file defines the objects used to represent a hierarchy of reads and alignments:
 *    GAReadGroupSet >--< GAReadGroup --< fragment --< read --< alignment --< linear alignment
 *
 * A GAReadGroupSet is a logical collection of GAReadGroup's.
 * A GAReadGroup is all the data that’s processed the same way by the sequencer.
 *    There are typically 1-10 GAReadGroup's in a GAReadGroupSet.
 * A *fragment* is a single stretch of a DNA molecule.
 *    There are typically millions of fragments in a GAReadGroup.
 *    A fragment has a name (QNAME in BAM spec), a length (TLEN in BAM spec), and an array of reads.
 * A *read* is a contiguous sequence of bases.
 *    There are typically only one or two reads in a fragment. If there are two reads, they’re known as a mate pair.
 *    A read has an array of base values, an array of base qualities, and alignment information.
 * An *alignment* is the way alignment software maps a read to a reference.
 *    There’s one primary alignment, and can be one or more secondary alignments.
 *    Secondary alignments represent alternate possible mappings -- they are rarely reported by aligners.
 * A *linear alignment* maps a string of bases to a reference using a single CIGAR string.
 *    There’s one representative alignment, and can be one or more supplementary alignments.
 *    Supplementary alignments represent chimeric reads -- they are rare.
 *
 * A GAReadAlignment object is a flattened representation of the bottom layers of this hierarchy.
 *    There's exactly one such object per *linear alignment*.
 *    The object contains alignment info, plus fragment and read info for easy access.
