    // The schemas here describe reference structures.
    
    // A reference structure is a graph-based representation of a reference
    // genome and a set of common sequence and structural variants. Such a
    // structure consists of a series of "Blocks" of linear DNA sequence. Each
    // block has two ends, a left (or 5') and a right (or 3'). Links called
    // "Adjacencies" connect these ends together. The presence of an adjacency
    // means that, in at least some people's genomes, the connected blocks of
    // sequence come one after the other, in the order and orientation defined
    // by the ends that are connected.
    
    // Every DNA base in a block (called a Position, but not represented as a
    // first-class object in this schema) has a unique, permanent 64-bit integer
    // identifier. Each Block stores the identifier of the first base in it and
    // the total length, and all the bases in a block must have sequential
    // identifiers. Blocks also store the sequence string for the bases they
    // represent, when read along the forward strand from left to right.
    
    // For referring to locations in Blocks, we define a "Face", which is an
    // enumerated type with values "LEFT" and RIGHT", and we define "Sides"
    // which are combinations of a Position (i.e. base) ID and a Face. A Side
    // represents the specified Face of the specified Position. For example:
    
    //
