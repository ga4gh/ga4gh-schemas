/*
variantannotations/search returns annotation for the alleles of classic/linear variants

This allows the mining of allele-specific annotations by either a region or a set of genomic
features. Where a region is supplied annotation of all alleles vs all features in the region
is returned. Where a set of features is supplied, only annotations against these features
(matching on featuretype and id) are returned and other overlapping features are ignored.

annotationsets/search returns information on reference data and software versions used in
calculating the annotation. It is essential this information is exhaustive.
