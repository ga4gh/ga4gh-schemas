/**
A Beacon is a web service that accepts a single variant position and nucleotide change.
The reply is either "true" or "false", indicating whether this variant has ever
been observed in the beacon's database and includes any other meta information the
beacon wants to share.

A beacon has two endpoints: /query (required) and /info (optional)
/query is used to obtain information about alleles
/info can be used to obtain information about the beacon itself
