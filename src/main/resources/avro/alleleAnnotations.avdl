/*

The VariantAnnotation record groups different types of annotation records by
Variant.

The TranscriptEffect sub record holds information on the effect of a specific
allele on a specific transcript.
As Variants may overlap multiple transcripts, they may have multiple
TranscriptEffect records. Variants with multiple alternate alleles will have
multiple TranscriptEffect records per transcript.
(2 alternate alleles x 3 transcripts = 6 TranscriptEffect records)

VariantAnnotation records belong to VariantAnnotationSets.
VariantAnnotationSets are created by comparing a number of Variants from a
VariantSet to a specific set of reference data using specific software tools.
A VariantAnnotationSet contains information on reference data and software
versions used in calculating the annotation; it is essential this information
is exhaustive.
