/**
A sequence graph is made progressively joining new sequence pieces, which we
call variants, into an existing graph.  This starts with a primary sequence. For
example consider the primary sequence in GRCh38 for a chromosome.  Then variants
can be joined into it, starting on a defined side of a defined base in the
existing structure, containing new sequence (potentially empty if a pure
deletion or breakpoint) and then joining back to another defined side of another
base in the current graph.

An arbitrarily complex reference graph is built this way, but we can also use
the same construction to specify individual variants from the reference.

Any base in the graph will have a unique identity defined by its variant id and
0-based position in the variant sequence.  It is oriented in the direction of
the variant sequence.

We support a context model for uniquely identifying bases in the graph.
Currently this is the UCSC left-right mapping proposal as proposed by Paten,
Haussler et al. - http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5010

Next we show how to provide information about samples.  The core idea is to
provide Calls which each contain information about an Allele in a CallSet.
Loosely the alleles correspond to rows in a VCF and the callsets to a column,
but there are some key differences.

First, we provide information separately about alleles not sites (unary variant
model).  We can determine from the graph whether two alleles are incompatible in
the same haplotype and hence "allelic" in the standard usage of the term.  Note
that this is a pairwise relation, not transitive, so we don't support sites as
sets of alleles in the way that VCF does.  This avoids the problems when merging
sites in VCF.  Our merge semantics are simple: only merge identical alleles.
Identity can be checked by name when sharing a global name and definition space,
or recursively by how the alleles are constructed from global objects when scope
is local.

Second, we represent phase information by separate haplotype callSets, rather
than using some sort of | or / or | notation or equivalent in the calls of a
genotype callSet.  So genotype callSets just contain allele counts (copy number)
or dosages.  This is the only way to provide phase data. Because we support
sparse callSets, which we hope can be lightweight, each piece of partial phasing
(as for example supported by phase sets in VCF) will be a separate haplotype
CallSet on the same sample.

Finally, note that while typically an Allele is short, this structure also
allows us to define a long allele as a literal sequence path through the graph
incorporating (parts of) multiple variants.

For example, it supports defining alleles to represent ALT haplotypes from
GRCh38 or an LRG (clinical locus-specific reference sequence) that differs from
the canonical reference.

Other people may want to define variants on these "Allele" sequences.  It would
be possible to write code to map those onto the reference graph.  This could
support mapping variants between coordinate systems.  There has been interesting
discussion about this in the context of dbSNP and representation of variation on
multiple references.
