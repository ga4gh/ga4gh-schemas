/**
  Protocol: Variant annotations

  This protocol represents variant annotations such as putative effects
  (also called consequences) and simple prioritization (also called impact). 

  For example, an annotation can represent a frame shift variant (having 
  a high impact) or a synonymous variant (having a low impact).

  Note: These records are based on annotated VCF files, such as those produced
        by SnpEff or ENSEMBL's VEP, having VCF INFO tags 'EFF' and 'CSQ' 
        respectively.
        As such, some of the standards refered to may not be followed 
        strictly. For instance, HGVS nomenclature suggests that 
        "silent changes" are represented as "p.=", but the equal sign is 
        not allowed in VCF fields. In these cases an alternative (sometimes 
        discouraged) representation may be used.
