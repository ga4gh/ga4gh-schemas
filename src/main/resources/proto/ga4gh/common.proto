/**
An enum for the different types of CIGAR alignment operations that exist.
Used wherever CIGAR alignments are used. The different enumerated values
have the following usage:

* `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`: An alignment match indicates that a sequence can be
  aligned to the reference without evidence of an INDEL. Unlike the
  `SEQUENCE_MATCH` and `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH` operators, the `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`
  operator does not indicate whether the reference and read sequences are an
  exact match. This operator is equivalent to SAM's `M`.
* `INSERT`: The insert operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
  bases being inserted into the reference. This operator is equivalent to
  SAM's `I`.
* `DELETE`: The delete operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
  bases being deleted from the reference. This operator is equivalent to
  SAM's `D`.
* `SKIP`: The skip operator indicates that this read skips a long segment of
  the reference, but the bases have not been deleted. This operator is
  commonly used when working with RNA-seq data, where reads may skip long
  segments of the reference between exons. This operator is equivalent to
  SAM's 'N'.
* `CLIP_SOFT`: The soft clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end
  of a read have not been considered during alignment. This may occur if the
  majority of a read maps, except for low quality bases at the start/end of
  a read. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'S'. Bases that are soft clipped
  will still be stored in the read.
* `CLIP_HARD`: The hard clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end of
  a read have been omitted from this alignment. This may occur if this linear
  alignment is part of a chimeric alignment, or if the read has been trimmed
  (e.g., during error correction, or to trim poly-A tails for RNA-seq). This
  operator is equivalent to SAM's 'H'.
* `PAD`: The pad operator indicates that there is padding in an alignment.
  This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'P'.
* `SEQUENCE_MATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the aligned
  sequence exactly matches the reference (e.g., all bases are equal to the
  reference bases). This operator is equivalent to SAM's '='.
* `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the
  aligned sequence is an alignment match to the reference, but a sequence
  mismatch (e.g., the bases are not equal to the reference). This can
  indicate a SNP or a read error. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'X'.
